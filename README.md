# swarm_drones

So this is a project on swarm drones using ardupilot and gazebo

Problems I am currently facing:-
  - In the launch file drone_connect.launch two drones should connect with namespaces "/drone1" and "/drone2" respectively but only "/drone1" is getting connected. We can the rostopics and rosservices of "/drone2" but the connection is not working.
  - To change the origin in local position of both drones with the origin of gazebo
